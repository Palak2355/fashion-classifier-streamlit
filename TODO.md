# TODO: Deploy Fashion Classifier on Streamlit

- [x] Create requirements.txt with dependencies: streamlit, tensorflow, numpy, pillow, pandas, scikit-learn
- [x] Create streamlit_app.py with Streamlit UI for image upload, prediction, and comparative analysis
- [x] Test the app locally using `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` (skipped due to TensorFlow compatibility issues on local Python 3.13.3 32-bit)
- [x] Provide guidance for deploying to Streamlit Cloud (upload to GitHub and connect)
